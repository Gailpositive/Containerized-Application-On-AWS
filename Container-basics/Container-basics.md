# Container-Basic


### In this exercise, I'll create an AWS Cloud9 instance and modify some of the environment settings. 
### You also install the prerequisites and source code that are needed to launch new container instances inside your AWS Cloud9 environment.

### I'll create the following resources:
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy and user (Policies and users are AWS account features, offered at no additional charge)
* AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE) instance
* AWS CloudFormation stack
* Amazon DynamoDB table

  ### Setting up
* This exercise requires an IAM role that will be used with the AWS Cloud9 instance. 
* It also requires a DynamoDB table that will be set up and then used in a later exercise.
* The CloudFormation stack will create these resources for me.
* I will also need to choose a Region where AWS App Runner is available.(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html)
